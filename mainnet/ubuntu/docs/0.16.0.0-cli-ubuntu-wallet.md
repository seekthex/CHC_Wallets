  Note: firewall will not become enabled until you reboot the Server

  curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seekthex/Server_Setup_Scripts/master/install-firewall.sh | bash



### Setup Swap File


  (Recommend) if you would need to create a 1 gig permanent swap filesystem

  curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seekthex/Server_Setup_Scripts/master/install-1-swap-p.sh | bash

  Note: if you are running a smaller VPS such as a Vultr 512 MB server you will need to install a 2 Gig Swap
        during the initial compile of chaincoin. however to run chaincoind you will only need a 1 Gig Swap file
        on the 512 MB server.
        You can find more swap file building scripts here.
